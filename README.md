In this I implemented a simple use of Command Pattern which is Undo command. In this case I created the differents components of the pattern which are: 

* Client 
* Abstract command -> A simple interface with 2 methods
* Invoker -> The assigned to store and execute the commands
* Concrete Command - Inherid the abstract command and the ability to be executed.
* Receiver
